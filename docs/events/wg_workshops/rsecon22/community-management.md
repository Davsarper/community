# TRE Satellite Event notes - Community management

## Prompts

- What tools & methods are we using to communicate?
- What are the areas that we should initially focus on?
- Who is involved?
- What should this community space be used for?
- What are our key principles for collaboration?

## Notes

- The other stuff is exciting but we can't do it without organising our community
- Community organisation needs resource
- We have conversations all the time but how do we manage follow-up
- How do we ensure a balanced conversation? Engineers, managers, data people, researchers, members of the public
- We need to build a community and then worry about management
- Who is in the community? What's the purpose of the community?
- Different uses/purposes for the TRE - e.g. different kinds of data
- We can't do it all at once - so how do we prioritise?
- Groupings around what people want - sharing of best practice etc - ensuring cross-pollination between groups
- [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) - could have some kind of 'hub'
- Documentation
- What do we do until we have someone who's job this is?
- How do we stay impartial/independent? How do we maintain perspective?
- The role of co-ordination doesn't necessarily set the strategic direction
- Assessing the national discussion/ongoing work around TREs
- How did RSEs do it?
- Survery of engineers and users
- Interoperable data standards

## Actions/next steps

### Immediate actions

- Agree on a purpose for the community?
- Agree on target audience for the community?
- Baselining survey - who has done what?
  - Size of team
  - Who are the end users/researchers
  - How big are your projects? value, number of researchers?
  - What are your IG processes?
  - What stack do you use? E.g. aws, azure
  - Are you open?
  - Cloud based or on prem?
  - Are you working with any other teams collaboratively?
  - What is the underlying software?
- Ask for time/money from host institutions
  - Clarify this in terms of amounts/time/numbers
- Get ideas/thoughts from communities that have done this successfully (e.g. RSECon)

### Longer term actions
